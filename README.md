# Mapping_Earthquakes
Create interactive maps using GeoJSON. Reviewing earthquakes, magnitude and fault lines around the world. This module was completed by using the following tools:

-JavaScript
Data Driven Docs (D3)
GeoJSON
Leaflet
MapboxAPI

It also gave us the opportunity to learn how to create and work in branches to update, test and visualize data without disrupting the working code. 

Below is the HTML link and the link to the .js code in the challenge.

The site contains 3 maps, and 2 overlays with descriptive information when you hover over the data. Earthquakes happen more often than people think. Be safe out there and shelter in place during COVID and earthquakes!
